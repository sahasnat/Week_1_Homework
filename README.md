# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Strategies

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use the `git add`, `
use git commit`, and 
`git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.



3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.
